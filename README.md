# Group Adjust
This repo contains two implementations of group_adjust: pure python and numpy. To test either one, run the following:
> pytest pure_python_implementation.py \
> pytest numpy_implementation.py

The pure python is more performant. However, the numpy implementation demonstrates some basic numpy array manipulation.
